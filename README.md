Paypal was initially founded by Max Levchin, Peter Thiel, and Luke Nosek.  Other founder include Ken Howery, Yu Pan, Elon Musk.

The initial company Confinity aimed to provide secure software for financial transactions on individually owned devices. It later switched to digital wallet due to the failure of security software development with the founders also claiming that it is safer since money cannot be stolen same way as cash from a  physical wallet.
